# Inside OLE 2nd Edition

This repository contains the text and companion code for Inside OLE 2nd Edition, by Kraig Brockschmidt, Microsoft Press, 1995.

The text can be found in either *InsideOLE.pdf* (which was printed from old MSDN browsers) or *Inside OLE.chm* (a Windows help file that should work on any system).

The code is in the *Code* folder. The *CD Files* folder contains the material that was on the root of the companion CD (omitting the .exe setup programs). The .txt files in the folder include the original readme, build instructions, errata, etc.

I haven't tried to build any of this code in a long time, so I leave that task up to the reader. If you'd like to make it all work with modern compilers (e.g. Visual Studio), please create a branch for those updates.

## Bonus Feature

Also included in this repository is a copy of a paper I wrote in 1995-1996 entitled *What OLE is Really About*. For a long time I thought this paper was lost, but I found it on an old MSDN CD, which is why the images are of poor quality.

As part of the OLE design team (OLE Program Management) at the time I'd hoped to really promote the ideas described in this paper. Presentations I did from this paper remain cherished experiences, and my favorite comment from one attendee was that "Kraig must has sold some snake oil in his day, because I came away convinced!" (But no, I've never sold snake oil.) But alas! priorities changed, the team was effectively disbanded, and I was asked instead to work on "competitive marketing literature." As I described in my memoir, *Mystic Microsoft*, I wasn't interested in that kind of work and decided to leave Microsoft in November 1996. My departure meant relinquishing the hopes I'd had for component software, but fortunately I was able to redirect the energy of those aspirations inwardly, into spiritual development.
