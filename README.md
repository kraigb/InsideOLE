# Inside OLE

Companion code for Inside OLE 2nd Edition, by Kraig Brockschmidt, Microsoft Press, 1995.

The code was originally shipped on a CD in the book. The root files from the CD at in the *CD Files* folder, with the exception of the .exe files that were just a setup program to copy the code to a hard drive. The .txt files in that folder include the original readme, build notes, errata, etc.

I haven't tried to build any of this code in a long time, so I leave that task up to the reader. If you'd like to make it all work with modern compilers (e.g. Visual Studio), please create a branch for those updates.
