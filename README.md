# Inside OLE 2nd Edition

This repository contains the text and companion code for Inside OLE 2nd Edition, by Kraig Brockschmidt, Microsoft Press, 1995.

The text can be found in either *InsideOLE.pdf* (which was printed from old MSDN browsers) or *Inside OLE.chm* (a Windows help file that should work on any system).

The code is in the *Code* folder. The *CD Files* folder contains the material that was on the root of the companion CD (omitting the .exe setup programs). The .txt files in the folder include the original readme, build instructions, errata, etc.

I haven't tried to build any of this code in a long time, so I leave that task up to the reader. If you'd like to make it all work with modern compilers (e.g. Visual Studio), please create a branch for those updates.
