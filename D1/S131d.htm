<H1>Chapter 23 In-Place Objects</H1><P><B><I>ACTIVE INGREDIENT:</I></B><I> tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride, 0.05%</I></P>
<P>Many medicines contain only a tiny amount of the key ingredient. For example, I have on my desk a small bottle of eye drops that I grabbed from the medicine cabinet. Of the 14.7 ml of liquid in this bottle, only a minuscule 0.00735 ml is the active ingredient; the rest is water. The addition of only a small amount of an active ingredient turns the liquid in the bottle into something of real value.</P>
<P>Compound document content objects are often the same way—the presence of a little feature can distinguish one from the rest of the crowd. If a content object is merely a small bottle of water, what will set it apart from the ocean of other content? A little bit of an active ingredient, such as in-place activation. Compared with the rest of a content object, the percentage of extra code necessary to implement in-place support is extremely small. Overall, it's nothing like what we had to do to create a container application in Chapter 22. Most of the work for activating an object in place, as you might imagine, is in building up and tearing down the in-place user interface, such as the shared menu and the in-place tools that we discussed in the first half of Chapter 22. Some objects need no such user interface, making the entire process even easier.</P>
<P>Because Chapter 22 already discussed the mechanics of in-place activation, this chapter is concerned with implementation. We'll add in-place capabilities to Cosmo and to Polyline, both of which we last saw in Chapter 21. As we'll see, almost the same steps apply to both local and in-process servers and their objects. One difference is that Polyline is marked as an activate-when-visible object, allowing you to explore that feature with Patron from Chapter 22. So if you're ready, let's see what we can accomplish with just a few drops of the programming equivalent of tetrahydrozoline HCl.</P></font></body></HTML>
