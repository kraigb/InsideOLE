<H2>Features of Automation Controllers</H2><P>Writing a simple controller is mostly a matter of calling the <I>IDispatch</I> members correctly. We'll cover this in "Calling <I>IDispatch</I>: A Simple Automation Client" later in this chapter. However, a controller that actually allows an end user to write, run, and debug a script needs to be more sophisticated. Features that sophisticated controllers generally have include the following:</P>
<UL><LI>Syntax structures that express property gets and puts, method calls (required, optional, and named arguments), and object creation and destruction in whatever programming language your controller supports</LI><LI>User interface for browsing and creating automation objects</LI><LI>Type information browsing—the ability to look at the capabilities of an object before and after creation</LI><LI>Compiling of a script into an executable, optimized for execution speed</LI></UL><P>The following two sections discuss the first two of these features; the last two features are primarily centered on type information we discussed in Chapter 3. Now is a good time to review that material. The type library (<I>ITypeLib</I>)<I> </I>and type information (<I>ITypeInfo</I>) objects that OLE can provide for any type library resource provide the browsing capabilities, and the act of compiling a script involves <I>ITypeComp</I>.</P>
<P>The information in these sections is intended to give you ideas—not to be a design primer or anything that precise. These are simply the things you'll want to think about that have direct correlation to the technical parts of OLE Automation.</P></font></body></HTML>
