<H2>Year-End Bonuses</H2><P>If you followed the HCosmo example in the previous sections, you now have a complete basic handler that is fully functional for rendering your object on a variety of displays, without depending on the cache or a local server. Anything else you do now is an added benefit to your handler—like giving it an extra paycheck at the end of the year.</P>
<P>There are many possibilities for improvement. You might want to implement <I>IDataObject::GetData</I> and <I>GetDataHere</I>, for example, to further reduce the need to launch a local server. After all, you already know how to draw your data in the handler, as well as how to save it to an <I>IStorage</I>, so you'd need to add only a bit of code to draw into a metafile or bitmap and to save into a different <I>IStorage</I>. You might think of ways to reduce your dependence on the cache, possibly managing it all yourself. You might consider adding features through a custom interface, given that you have a DLL and can provide a custom interface without the need for marshaling support. These new interfaces can do whatever you like. You can also implement a Play verb in <I>OleObject::DoVerb</I> if your object supports that sort of concept, again greatly improving performance and reducing your need for a server.</P>
<P>But eventually you cross the line. Give the handler too much extra pay and it decides to buy a yacht—for which it has to pay luxury tax. At that point, it ceases to rely on a local server for anything by implementing all of <I>IDataObject</I> and all of <I>IOleObject</I>, thus providing full editing services. The handler is now qualified to be an in-process server. But before it is confirmed as such, there are a number of points to consider.</P></font></body></HTML>
