<H2>Implementing an Object in C and C++</H2><P>Now that we've seen how to call interface member functions in C and C++, we can look as well at how you implement an object with an interface in both languages. Once we have established this level of understanding, we can use the convenience of C++ in the rest of this book, assured that all of the code is possible in C as well. To set the stage for this section, we need an object to implement.</P></font></body></HTML>
